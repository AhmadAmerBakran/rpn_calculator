RPN Calculator
This RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator app is developed as a mobile application assignment for the course at Business Academy Southwest, Denmark. It's designed to offer a straightforward method for performing calculations using the reverse Polish notation, where operators follow their operands. This method allows for the elimination of parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.

Getting Started

The RPN Calculator is built with Flutter, making it cross-platform and capable of running on both Android and iOS devices. To get started with this project, ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. For detailed instructions on setting up Flutter, refer to the Flutter documentation.

## Getting Started

The RPN Calculator is built with Flutter. To get started with this project, ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine.

## Installation

* Clone the repository to your local machine:

### note:

#### Make sure you have selected a virtual device or your device to run the app on it.


## How It Works

The RPN Calculator operates on a stack-based principle. Here's how to use it:

- Input the First Number: Type the first number into the calculator and press the En button to push this number onto the stack.

- Input the Second Number: Type the second number and follow the same process to add it to the stack or choose an operation (+, -, /, *) to apply to the numbers in the stack. The result will be displayed immediately.

- Continue Calculating: To use the result in further calculations, simply type another number and select an operation again. The app continues to use the stack's top value for subsequent operations.
